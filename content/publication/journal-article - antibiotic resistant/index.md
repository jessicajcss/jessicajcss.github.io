abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing global public health concern. This study aimed to investigate 
  the presence of bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes in the environment, more specifically in sewage and 
  bioaerosol samples collected at a Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP). Bacterial species were identified and 
  tested for antibiotic sensitivity. In addition, bla CTX-M, bla SHV, bla TEM and bla KPC genotypes, 
  including those related to resistance to carbapenems, were detected by PCR. The results of this research 
  are extremely important for understanding the mechanisms involved in antimicrobial resistance and for preventing 
  the dissemination of these antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. This study contributes to the identification of 
  sources of antibiotic resistance in the environment and implementation of AMR control and prevention strategies while
  preserving the effectiveness of antibiotics and public health.
